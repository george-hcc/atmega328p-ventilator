This is a Embedded-C project where I made an ventilator controller using the microcontroller ATMEGA328p. This project uses ADC, UART TX and RX, level and timer interruptions and a LCD display. It also actuates two servos used to control the percentage level of oxigen and the movement of the air pump. I simulated the workings of the firmware using the SIMULIDE software.
